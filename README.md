## Typical usage scenario

Visualize all possible options in your user interface, instead of forcing your user to open a dropdownlist to view all available options.

## Features and limitations
 
- Displaying the list in a horizontal or vertical direction.
- Specify text of the labels in case of a boolean attribute
- Attaching a microflow on the onchange event.

## Installation

Import the widget to your project and add either Radiobutton List or Radiobutton List Advance to a dataview on a page. Configure the properties to determine how the widget will behave in your application.

###Properties


##### General

###### Display

* *Direction* - Determines if the radiobutton list will render horizontally or vertically


###### Events

* *On change* - The microflow which will be invoked in case of a on change event.


##### Radiobutton list (based on an attribute)

###### Display

* *True label* - Label which will be shown in case your 'Target source attribute' is a boolean type and attribute value is 'True'
* *False label* - Label which will be shown in case your 'Target source attribute' is a boolean type and attribute value is 'False'


###### Target source

* *Attribute* - Attribute of type enumeration or boolean of which the values will be rendered as a radiobutton list.
 

##### Radiobutton list Advanced (based on an association)

###### Data source 

* *Entity to list* - Entity containing the attribute which should be rendered as a radiobutton list
* *Label* - (String) Attribute of which it's contents will be used as label
* *Association* - Association to be set to the selected option
* *Sort attribute* - Attribute of which the value will be used to determine the sort order
* *Sort order* - Determines if values of the sort attribute will be sorted ascending or descending
* *Data source type* - The method used for retrieving objects

###### Data source (XPath)

* *XPath constraint* - Constrain the list of objects to be retrieved

###### Data source (Microflow)

* *Data source microflow* - Microflow returning a list of objects

###Example

Example for radiobutton list based on an association:
There are two entities defined, namely 'CompanyDepartment' and 'Employee'.
The application requires the option to refer an employee to a department.
In this case 'Employee' is the owner of an association between the two entities. (Employee_Companydepartment).

The configuration of the widget's required properties would be:
Entity to list: CompanyDepartment
Label: Name (String attribute of  CompanyDepartment)
Association: Employee_CompanyDeparment/CompanyDepartment.

###Known bugs

Onchange has no effect on the form. Workaround: add a microflow to the onchange property of the widget.This microflow must contain a change activity. The change activity must have 'refresh in a client' enabled.
